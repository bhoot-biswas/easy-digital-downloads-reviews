## Getting Started ##

### Install the Plugin ###

#### Automatic Installation ####

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Reviews for Easy Digital Downloads” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found this plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

#### Manual Installation ####

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

### Update your Downloads ###

Reviews will automatically be visible for downloads created after enabling the plugin.  However, any download created prior to enabling the plugin will need to be "Updated" to allow the reviews to show.  This can be done by going to **Downloads => All Downloads** and clicking **Quick Edit** and then **Update**.

### If you have problems ###

#### Verify your Settings ####

Go to **Downloads => Settings => Extensions => Download Reviews** and make sure that **Enable Reviews** is checked.  Check the other settings and make sure they are set to your liking.

#### Ensure Comments are Enabled under Wordpress ###

Make sure that Comments are allowed on your WordPress site.  Some plugins exist to disable comments and these will break Reviews for Easy Digital Downloads!
